                    <br><br>
                    <p>Since 1985, an anonymous New York City group of women who wear guerrilla masks and go by the name “Guerrilla Girls” have been fighting sexism in museums and the art market. One of the first things they did was to identify the lack of female representation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where less than 5% of the artworks were by women artists. It resulted in the iconic poster “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?” which helped change the cultural trajectory. Today, things look less bad for women artists. But it is a minimal improvement that continues to be overshadowed by male dominance in all major areas of the art world. </p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>Sexism in major NYC museums has slightly decreased since the establishment of the Guerrilla Girls. For instance, artworks by female artists in MoMA’s art collection increased from 8 percent in 1985 to 18 percent in 2021. Since museums are one of the greatest trend setters in the artworld, we’d expect to see a similar change in what art is being bought on the market. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And indeed, an analysis of artworks being sold at one of New York’s biggest auction dealers, Christies, shows improvement for women artists</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In 1985, female-art was sold at about a 46% discount compared to art by male artists. In fact, female-art was sold for less than what it was valued, whereas male-art was sold for about 20 percent above its valued price. Cut to 2021, and things are looking less dark, but definitely not bright. Today, on average, people buy female-art for 33 percent above its valued price and male-art for 46 percent above its valued price. 
                    </p> <br>
                   <!-- <img src="./img/wordle-heatmap6.svg" class =graph>-->
                   <div alt = "hej" class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9702966"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>                    <br>
                   <p>This suggests two things: people are willing to pay more for art in general, and it’s less dependent on gender compared to 37 years ago. However, it’s worth asking who are these people that “estimate” the price of an artwork since the estimated price influences the value potential buyers put on an artwork. If the estimated price wasn’t biased against women, perhaps potential buyers wouldn’t be as well. </p> 
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    A study by the University of Oxford titled found that the quality of art does not depend on the artist’s gender but on people’s biases. In the study, the research showed participants hundreds of artworks and asked them to rate the artwork on a scale from one to ten depending on how much they liked it. When participants didn’t know the gender of the artist behind the artwork, there was no difference in how they rated male and female art. However, when participants were told the artist’s gender before announcing their score, the average score for female art fell 20 percent below that of male made art. The study concludes that art made by women “is sold for less solely because it’s made by women.” 
                   </p><br>
                   <p>This analysis also showed that the art market is becoming slightly less male dominated. Artworks by women increased from 4 to 12 percent between 1985 and 2021. But still, men continue to make up the vast majority and people who identify as non-binary are hardly included. </p>
                  <br>
                   <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/9703835"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                    <br>
                    <p>Art is notoriously difficult to value and it is widely recognized that factors such as taste play an important role in setting prices. However, multiple studies have made it clear that gender should not impact the value of art. The observed price difference between genders simply reflects a bias towards women. </p>
                <br><p>It’s summed up best by the NYT art critique, Greg Allen: </p><br>
                <p>“Asking why women's art sells for less than men's elicits a long and complex
                    answer, with endless caveats, entirely germane qualifiers and diverse,
                    sometimes contradictory reasons. But there is also a short and simple, if
                    unpopular, answer that none of those explanations can trump. Women's art
                    sells for less because it is made by women”
                    </p>   <br>
