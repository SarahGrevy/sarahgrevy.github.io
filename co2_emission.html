                    <br>
                    <pr>
                        The Covid-19 pandemic proved a disaster in many ways to the human race. But for the globe, there was a silver lining - namely a decrease in carbon dioxide emission. Due to government policies, energy patterns were drastically altered around the world. International borders were closed and people were confined to their homes. That meant no more taking the subway to work, spring breaks to the Bahamas, or visits to the movie theater. Yet due to Covid relaxations in the second half of 2020, CO₂ emissions have been making a comeback in some countries.
                    </p>
                     <br>
                     <p>
                        Global CO₂ emissions fell by 6.4% or 2.3 billion tonnes in 2020. This is a significant shift considering the majority of countries in the world have seen a steady increase in emissions every year in the past decades. It wasn’t until the Paris Agreement in 2016 that world leaders decided to at least try to slow down the rapid increase in emissions. And yet, the pandemic by far outperformed the Paris Agreement in terms of slowing down emissions. Still though, the decrease wasn't as big as many climate scientists had predicted given the pandemic's significant impact on people's day-to-day lives.
                     </p>
                    <br> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/8729423"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>     
                    <br>
                    <P>
                        Which countries saw the biggest decrease in CO₂ emissions? As you can see in the map above, almost every country saw a decrease but some more than others. Blue colors indicate that emissions were lower than before the pandemic. Red colors indicate they were higher. The darker the color, the higher or lower the emission. For instance, the U.S. saw a change of -10% which means it produces 10% less emissions in 2020 than in 2019 (hence it's color changed from baby blue to deep blue). Likewise, most countries in Europe saw significant reductions. Greece, for instance, saw an 18% drop and Spain 17%
                    </P>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While China saw a drastic decrease in CO₂ emissions during the first half of 2020, it was one of the first countries to recover from the pandemic. Hence, when things were semi-back to normal in China, the government turned up for a carbon-intensive economic recovery. As a result, in the 12 months since China began relaxing Covid-19 lockdowns, CO₂ emissions have exceeded pre-pandemic by 7%. China, therefore, saw an overall increase of 1.6% in 2020.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Other countries are expected to see the same result as with China. Once Covid relaxations are fully in place, governments are in a rush to make up for lost time and money by amping up coal and steel production. Likewise, people are tired from being confined to the indoors and will seek travel and energy heavy activities once finally out and about. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As seen in the graph below, different sectors of emissions are already recovering and are expected to level out by late 2021. 
                    </p><br>
                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8744318"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        One of the main emission contributors are power plants that burn fossil fuel, such as coal or natural gas, and industries that drill or mine for these energy sources. Then there are sectors humans are more familiar with on a day-to-day basis such as residential emission (emissions from cooking, space and water heating, clothes drying, etc.), surface transportation (by rail or road), and aviation (plane trips).
                    </p>
                    <p> <br>
                        Sectors that humans interact most with directly such as aviation and surface transportation were impacted the most at nearly 15% and 17% respectively. Yet they were also the fastest to recover once many countries invoked covid relaxations in the fall of 2020. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The United in Science 2021 report presents the latest data and findings related to climate change to inform policy and action. One of its key findings is that while emissions reduction during the start of the pandemic likely reduced the annual increase of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses, this effect is so small that it’s hard to statistically distinguish from natural variability. 
                    </p>
                    <br> 
                    <P>
                        “Throughout the pandemic we have heard that we must build back better to set humanity on a more sustainable path and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on society and economies. This report shows that so far in 2021 we are not going in the right direction,” said Prof. Taalas, one of the main researchers on the report. 
                    </P>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    While the Covid-19 pandemic might have offered a short-term reduction in global emissions, the pace at which countries are rebounding will likely outdo it.  According to the United in Science, the world won’t meet the goals of the Paris Agreement for 2030 unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization.
