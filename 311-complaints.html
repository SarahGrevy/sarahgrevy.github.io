                    <br>
                    <p>
                        New York City is a dangerous place to walk and text. Traffic, unsafe sidewalks, and piles of trash bags are waiting on every corner to trip over an unfortunate pedestrian. But few people talk about the alarming amount of poop that decorates New York City’s streets. Stepping in poop on your way to an important meeting or romantic dinner is a sure way to ruin the vibe. Here are the areas in NYC with the most 311 poop complaints that you might want to avoid when stepping outside in your brand new white sneakers. 
                    </p><br>
                    <iframe title="Poop Complaints per 10,000 Residents" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-wz5UQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wz5UQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="745"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
                    </script> <br>
                    <p>
                        Overall, 311 poop complaints have been increasing slightly in the past two years from about 6 complaints per square mile to 6.5 complaints. While Manhattan by far has the most dogs per capita, probably given the correlation between wealth and pet-ownership, it is neighborhoods in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx that get the most complaints. Bronx County, for instance, got the most complaints in 2021 followed by Glendale in Queens and Kings County in Brooklyn. 
                     <p> <br>
                        The Upper West and East Side of Manhattan got very few complaints despite having the most dog-populated zip codes in NYC. However, they are also among the most expensive areas to live and might have more resources to keep the streets clean. It might also be that people in these neighborhoods are more likely to clean up after their dogs because it’s so densely populated. If someone is walking behind you on the street, you’re more likely to pick up after your dog to avoid being judged.                        <br>

                    <P>
                        Brooklyn has the most poop complaints of the five NYC borogus overall with an average of 9.4 complaints per square mile whereas Staten Island has the least complaints at just 3 complaints per square mile. Interestingly, 2020 was a very clean year for Brookly. Complaints fell with nearly 20 percent to the point that Bronx and Manhattan got more complaints. But complaints in Brooklyn rose to previous levels in 2021. One street stands out in particular in Brooklyn, namely 556 82 Street located in Bay Ridge in the south of Brooklyn. This street got 32 complaints in the past year outperforming every other street in Brooklyn. Mainly a residential area, it remains to be investigated whether the complaints are filed by just one person who is extremely observant of street hygene, or whether this street happens to be a convinient waste release area for dogs in the neighborhood.                     <p>

                            Brooklyn rose to previous levels in 2021. One street stands out in particular in Brooklyn, namely 556 82 Street located in Bay Ridge in the south of Brooklyn.

                  <p>
                    But it’s not just dogs that are the root of these complaints. While they make up 75 percent of all animal waste complaints, cats make up for 23 percent and “other” make up the remaining 20 percent. It is especially this mysterious category “other” that is interesting to have a closer look at. Between September 8th and 21th of this year, a spike of 91 ‘Other’ 311 complaints occurred in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. “Other” complaints usually stems from pigeon or human waste, so perhaps a huge pigeon or human gathering was happening at this place and time. 
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    To conclude, Manhattan might be the best place for you to take a stroll. Not only is it a densely doggie populated area, but you get to pet dogs without getting your sneakers dirty.
