  <h2> The Gender Gap in Art Continues with NFTs </h2>

</div> -->

<div class="text">
  <p> Canadian singer Grimes, whose real name is Claire Elise Boucher, has always made waves in terms of internet fame. From everything to selling a “piece of her soul” online to her successful music career in a genre she defines as “ethereal nu metal,” Grimes maintains an offbeat and artistically adventurous presence. Last year, she revealed another surprising turn to her career when she released a collection of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the digital art auction platform NiftyGateway. Right at the peak of the crypto goldrush, Grimes sold her collection for $5.8 million, making her the highest-selling female NFT artist todate.</p>
  
  <p>Grimes’ collection, entitled Battle of the WarNymphs, depicts modernized and tattooed Michelangelo-esque cherubs flying around distant planets, holding hammers and spears. These babies, as some people have speculated, are rooted in her pregnancy with Tesla CEO and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk. (Last January, the recently separated couple announced the puzziling name for their son: X Æ A-Xii.)</p>

  <p>One of the most popular pieces of the collection, Death of the Old, is reminiscent of a music video: the viewer, alongside cherubs, fly through space towards a distant cross standing on what appears to be the rocky surface of planet Mars. It’s accompanied by Grimes’s girlish tone and noticeable lips, singing mostly unintelligible lyrics, resembling an electronic lullaby. The video is one of the most frequently sold pieces in the collection selling for over $300,000. Two other pieces of the collection entitled Earth and Mars were on sale for $7,500 each and sold out in 20 minutes. Grimes sold 691 of the pieces together, totaling up $5.8 million total for the collection.</p>

  <p>Grimes’ record-breaking sale and NFT’s exploding popularity has left many people outside the crypto space wondering what exactly an NFT is. Simply put, an NFT is data stored on a blockchain. A blockchain is a digital transaction system where individuals can own access to different “blocks”. In order for Grimes to sell an NFT, she had to claim legal ownership over it by “minting’ it or tokenizing it onto the blockchain. The point being that it’s easier to track copyright ownership while also making it difficult to hack. </p>

  <p>The awkward part about NFTs is that anyone can in theory download the digital artwork or simply screenshot it. But this doesn’t mean that they own it or can profit of it, as opposed to legally owning the data. In comparision to physical art, owning an NFT is like having a Monet original. Screenshotting it is like buying a copy at your local art store. </p>

  <h3><br>gender gap</h2>
  <p>Social media was taken by storm when Grimes’s collection sold out. Not just because she was a celebrity, but because she was a woman who had successfully infiltrated a male-dominated crypto space. To this day, Grimes remains the only woman to crack the top ten of highest selling NFTs. All other high-earning artists have been almost exclusively men. That list includes Beeple, an American digital artist who in 2021 sold the most expensive NFT to date for $69.3 million. Or the programmer Murat Pak, who last year sold an NFT entitled Clock for $52.7 million. The NFT is a dynamic timer that counts the number of days Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has spent in prison.</p>

  <p>Christophe Spaenjers, associate professor of Finance at HEC Paris, said that the lack of female representation in the NFT space might be due to the crypto and tech industry being male dominated. “If you think about the buyers of NFTs, it’s usually crypto-crowd enthusiasts or somebody like finance folks,” Spanjers said. “Typically, it is men that are very interested in this. We see this also on social media, where it’s a more male-dominated conversation, typically with people who have made money in the crypto sector.” </p>

  <p>The gender gap in the NFT space is echoing the long-standing lack of female representation in the larger world of art. As the feminist activist group, the Guerilla Girls pointed out in 1985, women have always had a crucial role to play in art, but usually as the nude subjects depicted on a canvas, not as creators. Women artists have definitely seen improvement in terms of representation, but these are minor improvements that are still far from where the standard should be today. For instance, New York City’s major art museums, whose rhetoric in the past decades have promised more equal gender representation, continue to be highly male-dominated with women making up just 10% of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s contemporary exhibition, 12% of Museum of Modern Art’s, and 25% of the Whitney Collection, according to open source data.</p>

  <p>Renee Adams, a Professor of Finance at Oxford University, has spent most of her career researching how gender intersects with corporate governance and the art market. In her paper “Gender is in the eyes of the beholder,” Adams found that paintings by artists who identity as female were sold at a 47% discount. She also examined whether this discount was due to biological factors or to culturally determined gender roles. To test this, she had people identify the gender of the artist simply by looking at a painting. Participants guessed the gender of an artist 50.5% of the time which is statistically indistinguishable from random. This suggests that the gender of an artist doesn’t impact the quality of the artwork. </p>

  <p>“When first trying to publish our story, people’s initial reaction to the price discount seen for women was that this must reflect a quality discount,” Adams said over a Zoom interview earlier this spring. “So art by women in some sense must be systematically worse than art by men because we all know that markets are efficient. So they had a very hard time accepting that perhaps the gender discount was a reflection of bias and not quality.“</p>

  <p>It is exaclty this bias that the NFT space was predicted to get ride off, creating a fresh start for women and minority artists seeking to make it in the art world. An article published in 2021 entitled “Democracy and Community, “Why NFTs will Change the Art World”, postulated that the crypto art world would eliminate the need “of middlemen and arbitrators of taste” such as art dealers, publishers, and anybody who somehow influences  which art is “good” and which is “bad.” </p>

  <p>Yet, surprisingly, the gender gap in the crypto space turned out to be even larger than in the traditional art world. Just 5% of NFTs sold on Niftgateway are by artists who identify as female, according to a report by the research firm ArtTactic. In comparison, 12% of paintings sold by the British auction house Christie's are by female artists.</p>

  <p>Maria Gertsberg, assistant professor in Finance at Melbourne University researching Gender and Evaluation Biases, said in an interview that NFT artists ostensibly had less barriers to break: “For NFTs you don't need a studio. That makes art production cheaper,” she said. “Women tend to have less flexibility because they have childcare and responsibilities. But NFTs you can do from home,” she added.</p>

  <p>One of the most significant predictors of success for an artist is being scouted by an art dealer. This is crucial to provide a network and to introduce the artist to collectors. However, when those dealers visit art schools to scout for promising artists, they tend to simply look for what buyers traditionally tend to like and what therefore sells for significant money. </p>

  <p>“Historically, most superstar artists have been male artists, so if you take this as a characteristic that needs to be fulfilled, then that’s what art dealers will look for,” Gertsberg said. “If you don't have a middleman anymore, but you instead represent yourself, this should remove a barrier for women.”</p>
